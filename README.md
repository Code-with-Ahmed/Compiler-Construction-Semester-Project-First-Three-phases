# Compiler Construction Semester Project

## Overview

This semester project on compiler construction is a comprehensive exploration of lexical analysis, syntax analysis utilizing an LL(1) parser, and semantic analysis. The project includes a robust implementation of a compiler capable of tokenizing, parsing, and analyzing the semantics of source code written in a specific programming language, adhering to a defined grammar (see the provided PDF).

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis:** Efficiently tokenizes source code.
- **Syntax Analysis:** Implements an LL(1) parser for in-depth syntax analysis.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Provides a thorough analysis of the semantics of the source code.
- **Symbol Table:** Implements a global symbol table for effective variable tracking.

## Grammar

- This project is designed to work with a specific grammar. Refer to the provided PDF for details.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  
    git clone (Repo Link)
    
2. **Build the Compiler:**
    
    cd compiler-construction-project
  

3. **Run the Compiler:**
    
    ./compiler input_source_code.txt
